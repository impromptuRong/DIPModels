# Digital Image Processing Models

This package collects deep learning models for general purpose image processing. 

Currently the package support following models:
* An wrapper for image classification model on different backbone.
* [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) with FPN on ResNet101 from [matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).
* [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
